# Diceware Password Generator

Dicewareâ„¢ is a method for picking passphrases that uses ordinary dice to select words at random from a special list called the Diceware Word List. Each word in the list is preceded by a five digit number. All the digits are between one and six, allowing you to use the outcomes of five dice rolls to select a word from the list.

Although Diceware purists will proclaim that one must use physical dice to generate their passphrase, this app uses a random number generator. For those purists, this app also provides a simple interface for translating a sequence of 5 digit numbers into Diceware words.
